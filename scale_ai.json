  "news": "The global data annotation tools market is segmented into annotation type, component, end-user, and region. The spread of Covid-19 acted as a major factor driving the growth of the global data annotations market. Rise in demand for text annotation for document classification is projected to provide opportunities during the forecast period. Data annotation tools are designed to reveal the features by training the algorithms to identify the features in data that have not been annotated. IT & Telecommunication segment contributed to the largest share in 2020. However, the healthcare segment is expected to manifest the highest CAGR of 31.4% from 2021 to 2030. The growth of the global data annotation tools is majorly driven by surge in penetration of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions. The growing adoption of data annotation for medical imaging data and rising investments in the development of autonomous driving technologies are anticipated to provide lucrative opportunities for the industry. High cost and lack of skilled labor associated with manual annotation of complex acts as a prime restraint. The solution segment dominated the data annotation tools market size in 2020 and is projected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. Based on region, North America contributed to the highest share in 2020, holding nearly two-fifths of the total share. On the other hand, Asia-Pacific is anticipated to manifest the fastest CAGR of 31.1%. North America holds a significant share in the global data annotation tools market. The adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology across healthcare and IT & telecommunication level is expected to propel the growth of the industry in this region. Surge in demand for text annotation for document classification technologies across government and BFSI sectors in North America is anticipated to boost the growth.
