To view an earlier snapshot click here and then modify the date indicated. In a new essay called “The Gentle Singularity,’ OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared his latest vision for how AI will change the human experience over the next 15 years. OpenAI executives have indicated that the company is focused on getting AI models to come up with new, interesting ideas about the world. In May, Google released a paper on AlphaEvolve, an AI coding agent. Another startup backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, FutureHouse, claims its AI can generate novel insights. If successful, these companies could automate a key part of the scientific process, and potentially break into massive industries such as drug discovery, material science, and other fields with science at their core. In May, Anthropic launched a program to support scientific research. In January, Altman wrote about OpenAI's plans in a blog. The broader scientific community remains somewhat skeptical of AI’s ability to generate genuinely original insights. Kenneth Stanley, a former OpenAI research lead, also previously told TechCrunch that today's AI models cannot generate novel hypotheses. Stanley is now building out a team at Lila Sciences, a startup that raised $200 million to create an AI-powered laboratory. Whether OpenAI truly creates an AI model that is capable of producing novel insights remains to be seen. Still, Altman’s essay may feature something familiar — a preview of where OpenAI is likely headed next. and interesting. It may also offer a glimpse of where the company is likely to go next.",
